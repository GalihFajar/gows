# Gows (Go with Socket)
Despite its awful naming, Gows is a project which purpose is to learn a lower level of 
REST API. Usually, devs either use net/http or web frameworks such as Gin, but here 
the approach for achieving the similar goal is by a slightly lower level, using socket.
Please be mindful this project is currently for educational purposes only. It's not
intended to be used for more advanced, production grade, use cases.
